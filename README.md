# Final Project â€“ Book Library API

## Project Overview
This project was built as the final assignment for the Coursera Express course. The core objective was to build a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js, where I learned how to implement POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE operations. I also gained hands-on experience with API development and used Postman to test various endpoints. Although I faced some difficulties while testing, I was able to troubleshoot and resolve the issues successfully.

## Features
- **Book Library System:** Add, update, delete, and view books and authors.
- **User Authentication:** Modified auth.js to update credentials and manage user authentication.
- **User Registration:** Implemented a feature to create and store new users.
- **API Testing with Postman:** Verified API responses through Postman to ensure functionality.
- **Express.js Implementation:** Built the backend using Express for efficient routing and middleware handling.
